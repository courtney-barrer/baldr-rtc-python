[x] make it a github repository (https://github.com/courtney-barrer/baldr-rtc-python)
[x] implement telemetry write state (on/off). Default off (core/state.py, server.py)
[x] implement shared memory and semaphores for camera subframe read and DM SHM write (based on beam #). Look at my dcs/simulation python examples of using the shared memory 
[x] implement with Null baseline and simulation mode (e.g. in config*.toml use mode = Null | simulation | shm baldr_rtc_python/baldr_rtc/io/backend_tests/test_simulation_backend.py)
[x] implement configure function to config it with legacy 

[ ] implement rtc loop math (without abstract controller class, just basic leaky default)
[ ] telemetry 
[ ] gui 
[ ] implement abstract controller class (leaky and PID)
[ ] test jitter

[x] make it a github repository (https://github.com/courtney-barrer/baldr-rtc-python)
[x] implement telemetry write state (on/off). Default off (core/state.py, server.py)
[ ] implement shared memory and semaphores for camera subframe read and DM SHM write (based on beam #). Look at my dcs/simulation python examples of using the shared memory
